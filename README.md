## Challenges

During this process, I had lots of trouble finding the energy to work on this major project. Despite being extremely excited about the freedom that the portfolio website project provided, I ended up struggling a lot with severe insomnia which definitely took its toll. 

Within the project itself, I found aligning all the items to be the most challenging part of the process. I tried to use *flexbox* for the most part, but I ended up having trouble with it, so I switched to using *position:absolute* as a way to position my images and text blocks instead. 

## Lessons Learned

I think overall, I learned how important it is to have a clear plan for the development of the website. Although I had my design down, I should have spent more time building a more solid foundation to avoid having to backtrack as often as I did.
